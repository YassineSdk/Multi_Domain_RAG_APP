      "\n",
      "In most risk‑management frameworks the **likelihood** (or probability) of a risk is the chance that the risk event will actually occur within a given time horizon (e.g., a project phase, a fiscal year, the life of a product).  It is usually expressed as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **A probability** (0 – 1 or 0 % – 100 %) – quantitative.  \n",
      "* **A rating** (e.g., “Rare”, “Unlikely”, “Possible”, “Likely”, “Almost Certain”) – qualitative, often mapped to a numeric range for calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall **risk exposure** is then often computed as  \n",

      "If you have **N** observation periods (e.g., years) and observed **k** occurrences of the event:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\hat{p} = \\frac{k}{N}\n",
